Once there you can see under **Subscriptions** -> **Subscribed HTML5 applications** -> Column: **Application** your link to your personal WebIDE. Click on the **Application URL** to open it.  

Once there you start in the home screen. Below is an **Import an Application** section. Choose **Clone from Git Repository** and insert your GitHub/Gitlab/etc repository URL. Insert username and password at the bottom and you are good to go.  

Your project should be included in the workspace now and the project files are marked with a green dot. You can manage your code with the git pane on the right.
